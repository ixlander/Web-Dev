    <h2>Basic info</h2>
    
    <!-- This paragraph is based on Pamela's personal opinion -->
    <p>Rabbits are little creatures with long ears and puffy tails, and they move their nose up and down in an adorable way. They eat the most orange vegetables in <em>our</em> world, and <strong>they reproduce more than any human <em>ever</em> has</strong>.</p>
    
    <!-- This paragraph is based on the Wikipedia article -->
    <p>Rabbits are small mammals in the family Leporidae of the order Lagomorpha. There are eight different genera in the family classified as rabbits, including the European rabbit and cottontail rabbits. The other rabbit species, along with pikas and hares, make up the order Lagomorpha. The male rabbit is called a buck and the female rabbit is a doe; a young rabbit is a kitten or kit (confusingly!).</p>
