            <h6>Posted on May 15, 2023</h6>
            
            <p>Today marks the beginning of my exciting journey into the world of programming! I've always been fascinated by how websites and applications work, and I've finally decided to take the plunge and learn how to create them myself.</p>
            
            <p>I started by researching different programming languages and decided to begin with web development. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript seem like the perfect trio to start with. I'm looking forward to building my first web pages and seeing them come to life in the browser.</p>
            
            <p>My goals for the next few weeks:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Learn the basics of HTML</li>
                <li>Understand how CSS works</li>
                <li>Create a simple personal website</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>I'm both nervous and excited about this new adventure. Here's to the start of something amazing!</p>
        </div>

            <h2 id="html-css">Learning HTML and CSS</h2>
            <h6>Posted on June 1, 2023</h6>
            
            <p>It's been a couple of weeks since I started my programming journey, and I'm happy to report that I've made significant progress with HTML and CSS!</p>
            
            <p>I've learned how to structure a web page using HTML tags like <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>. It's amazing how these simple tags can create a solid foundation for a website.</p>
            
            <p>CSS has been a bit more challenging, but also incredibly rewarding. I've learned about:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Selectors and how to target specific elements</li>
                <li>The box model and how it affects layout</li>
                <li>Flexbox for creating responsive designs</li>
                <li>Color theory and how to choose a pleasing color scheme</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>I'm particularly proud of this little CSS snippet I wrote to create a gradient background:</p>
            <pre><code>
body {
    background: linear-gradient(to right, #3498db, #2c3e50);
    color: white;
}
            </code></pre>
            
            <p>Next up: JavaScript! I can't wait to add interactivity to my web pages.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="post">
            <h2 id="javascript">Diving into JavaScript</h2>
            <h6>Posted on June 15, 2023</h6>
            
            <p>Wow, time flies when you're having fun coding! I've now started my journey into JavaScript, and it's opening up a whole new world of possibilities.</p>
            
            <p>JavaScript is quite different from HTML and CSS. It's a full-fledged programming language that allows me to add interactivity and dynamic content to my web pages. Here are some key concepts I've learned so far:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Variables and data types</li>
                <li>Functions and how to use them</li>
                <li>Conditional statements (if/else)</li>
                <li>Loops for repeating actions</li>
                <li>DOM manipulation to change HTML elements</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>I'm particularly excited about event listeners. They allow me to make my web pages respond to user actions. Here's a simple example I wrote:</p>
            
            <pre><code>
document.getElementById('myButton').addEventListener('click', function() {
    alert('Hello, World!');
});
            </code></pre>
            
            <p>This code displays an alert when a button is clicked. It's a small step, but it feels like magic to see my web page come alive with interactivity!</p>
            
            <p>My next goals are to learn about APIs and how to fetch data from servers. I'm also planning to start a small project to put all these new skills into practice. Stay tuned for more updates on my programming journey!</p>
